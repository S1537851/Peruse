            <h3>Brief History:</h3>
            <p> St. Louis was founded in 1764 by French fur trades Pierre Laclède and Auguste Chouteau. The city was named after King Louis IX of France. The location of the city made it 
                popular because of the Mississppi River for trading and transportation.<br>
                In 1803, the city became part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase. It soon was officially incorporated on December 9, 1822.
                Later, it earned the nickname <i>"Gateway to the West"</i> because it served as the departure point for westward exploration,
                including the famous Lewis and Clark expedition. In the 19th century, St. Louis grew due to the railroads and river commerce,
                which brought in immigrants such as Germans and Irish.<br>
                Today, St. Louis is an important economic and cultural center for Missouri. It serves as a role for the Gateway Arch for the expansion of the midwest.
