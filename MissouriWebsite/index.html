            <p>Missouri has a long history. The land was first home to the Native Americans and their culture. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, French explorers were the first to reach the land. 
                Later on, it became part of the Louisiana Territory. In 1803, the United States purchased this land in the Louisiana Purchase, doubling the size of the nation. 
                Soon after, Lewis and Clark began to explore their famous expedition from St. Louis, which became known as the <i>"Gateway to the West."</i> 
            </p>
            <p>Missouri is known for its nickname, the <i>"Show-Me State."</i> The name came from Congressman Willard Duncan Vandiver. 
                In 1899, he made a speech saying, "I'm from Missouri, and you have got to show me." This famous speech led Missourians to be known as being skeptical. 
                However, this may be the case. Others say it may have come from an early stage. In Colorado, the theory originated in a mining story where Missourians went to Colorado for the strike in the 1890s. 
                While there people would say, "That man from Missouri you'll have to show him.” </p>
