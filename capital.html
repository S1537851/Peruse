            <h3>Brief History:</h3>
            <p> Jefferson City was founded in 1821 and was named after the U.S. President Thomas Jefferson. It soon replaced St. Charles once the government buidling was completed. The city was laid out by Daniel Morgan Boone.
                It was officially incorporated in 1825 and in 1826 the state legislature moved there while the town was still small. <br>
                During those years Jefferson City population was 1,174, including 262 salves. A state penitentiary was built in 1836, which gave the city a positive strength. In 1837, the Capitol was 
                burnt down and a few years later a new one was built. <br>
                In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Jefferson City has grown. Today, it has new infrastucture, hospitals, and transportation systems. A new Capitol was built in 1924.
