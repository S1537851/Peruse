Hello! My name is Paden Ruckman and I am 24 years old.
I am new to programming but I enjoy the challenge and the problem solving.
I have 4 siblings, 3 older brothers and a little sister; and a blended family, which includes 7 of us.
What I like to do for my free time is go to outside to walk my dog, read my bible, and I just picked up golfing.
I am excited where this course will take me and for my future.
I have a big family!
